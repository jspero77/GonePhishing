  greetings:
  - Hello Admin! Today, there is an uptick of urgent phishing scams, and a general
    increase in scams that are too good to be true! These are things you might know,
    like a bunch of free money or a car! Also they could threaten you to accept these
    fast, so please keep an eye out!

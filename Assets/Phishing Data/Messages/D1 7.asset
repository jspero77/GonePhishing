  greetings:
  - "Before I clock out for the day, I\u2019ve been checking the status on the cameras
    cause the system keeps flagging an unauthorized connection. Problem is, it won\u2019t
    tell more details and I can\u2019t do anything with out this dumb company we
    hired to send someone to come look at it so our contract doesn\u2019t break.
    This is dumb as hell, and it\u2019s just cause we wanted to save money. Just
    don\u2019t relay on the cameras to capture everything for awhile."
  part1s:
  - "Hmm, I\u2019ll take a look tomorrow. Think I\u2019ll send an email companywide
    as well."
  part2s:
  - "Gotcha, I\u2019ll keep note of it. Probably going to send an email to everyone
    as well."
  part3s:
  - "Let me take a look then I\u2019ll ask the contractor. Likely will send an email
    letting everyone know tom as well."

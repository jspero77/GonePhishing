  greetings:
  - "I\u2019m sending this email to you because we\u2019ve had this weird issue where
    the computer we\u2019re using for the audio production locks up and we have to
    wait like 40 seconds to start using it again. I don\u2019t want any downtime
    during the times we\u2019re broadcasting, so maybe see about procuring an upgrade
    for our computer or seeing what\u2019s wrong? \n\nKindly,\n\nIvan"

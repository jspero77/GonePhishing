  greetings:
  - "I\u2019m sending this email to you because we\u2019ve had this weird issue recently
    where the computer we\u2019re using for the audio production locks up and we
    have to wait like 40 seconds to start using it again. I don\u2019t want any downtime
    during the times we\u2019re broadcasting, so maybe see about procuring an upgrade
    for our computer or seeing what\u2019s wrong?\nKindly,\nIvan"
  part1s:
  - "I\u2019ll get back to you soon, and I\u2019ll ask management if they can expense
    it."
  part2s:
  - "I\u2019ll take a look at the computer later."
  part3s:
  - "Ivan, you just told me you didn\u2019t need a new computer a few months ago."

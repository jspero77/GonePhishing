  - "Hello admin, I hope you\u2019re doing well. Recently, our company has been under
    some intense public scrutiny due to some\u2026 ethical concerns. As a result,
    some internet sleuths may be trying to breach the system. Keep an eye out for
    anything suspicious, like something needing to get done now, or anything that
    seems too good to be true. Good luck."

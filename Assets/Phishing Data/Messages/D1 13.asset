  greetings:
  - I am writing to you as we have on your files that a 100,000 car from Grotti was
    bought in your name and you have not paid any taxes for this. If this is not
    you then please respond.
  part1s:
  - I think your files are wrong or messed up cause I never bought a car.
  part2s:
  - "Ask Bruce, looks like something he\u2019d buy, not me."
  part3s:
  - "Find someone else, I\u2019m too broke for a Grotti"

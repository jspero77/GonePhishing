  greetings:
  - "Just got word from a old place I worked at that they had to shut down the company
    due to a bunch of files being leaked. A bunch of people just lost there jobs
    due to some annoying person who decide to get there hands on files and leak them
    to the world. Goes to show you just how much of a danger these people are. Apparently
    some hacker from another company managed to get into their systems due to a tech
    manager opening a email and clicking a link that installed malware. From there
    they leaked everything to the company that hired them. We gotta be aware of stuff
    like this, we can\u2019t be running into the same crap."
  part1s:
  - Agreed, the world is a scary place and we gotta keep vigilant.
  part2s:
  - "Keep me posted on this, that\u2019s something to watch over the next while."
  part3s:
  - Certainly interesting, we gotta keep our eyes peeled for stuff like this for
    sure.

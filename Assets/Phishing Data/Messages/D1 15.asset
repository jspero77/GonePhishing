    Offer Code Legit?'
  greetings:
  - Hi Admin, thanks for *finally* listening to me and my problems, I expect this
    error to go away soon right? Anyway, I'm emailing for a 48h offer code we got
    from these guys, called Baggy Baggutes. They seem legit but hard to know. Can
    you verify this for me? I did some digging but the spot seems local, unless the
    website was fake or something
  part1s:
  - Just got an email from them, they're fake.
  part2s:
  - They're a fake company. Received an email earlier from them for something else.
    Keep vigilant on these guys, and maybe try digging deeper?
  part3s:
  - Think they're legit, should be good.
  signoffs:
  - Hi
  phishing:
  - No

  greetings:
  - "I\u2019m sending this email to you because we\u2019ve had this weird issue recently
    where the computer we\u2019re using for the audio production locks up and we
    have to wait like 40 seconds to start using it again. I don\u2019t want any downtime
    during the times we\u2019re broadcasting, so maybe see about procuring an upgrade
    for our computer or seeing what\u2019s wrong?\nKindly,\nIvan"
  - "Hey I have this error on my computer that I emailed you about two weeks ago
    and you ignored me. I emailed last week as well but I didn\u2019t get a reply.
    I\u2019m getting sick of this, and if you don\u2019t help me, so god help me
    I\u2019m reporting you to the manager. It\u2019s some pop up saying I\u2019m
    out of space on my cloud storage, and I can\u2019t save anything!\nMAKE IT GO
    AWAY!!"
  - "Yo dude, I got this email from this company, it\u2019s got some sick deals about
    computers on sale! I think we should take a look actually, it\u2019s like top
    end hardware for like 99% off! And it\u2019s got a 2 for one deal! What a steal!
    And it\u2019s not from RamPC! It says we gotta act quick though, the sale only
    lasts 12 hours. I\u2019m gonna buy some stuff for our department with the company
    card."
  - "You\u2019ve spent over 250,000 thousand dollars today. Are you sure this is
    you? We\u2019ve locked your card, please contact us if this is you."
  - I am writing to you as we have on your files that a 100,000 car from Grotti was
    bought in your name and you have not paid any taxes for this. If this is not
    you then please respond.
  part1s:
  - "I\u2019ll get back to you soon, and I\u2019ll ask management if they can expense
    it."
  - "Jeez calm down Jenelle, I\u2019ll take a look now."
  - "Gully, this seems way too good to be true, don\u2019t buy anything."
  - I think one of our coworkers just fell for a phishing scam.
  - I think your files are wrong or messed up cause I never bought a car.
  part2s:
  - "I\u2019ll take a look at the computer later."
  - Jenelle you sure this is meant for me? Seems super aggressive.
  - "Hang on, take a look at RamPC and see if they\u2019re legit, then buy it."
  - "This isn\u2019t real."
  - "Ask Bruce, looks like something he\u2019d buy, not me."
  part3s:
  - "Ivan, you just told me you didn\u2019t need a new computer a few months ago."
  - This is spam right?
  - Sounds good, let me know how it goes!
  - This is not us, find someone else.
  - "Find someone else, I\u2019m too broke for a Grotti"

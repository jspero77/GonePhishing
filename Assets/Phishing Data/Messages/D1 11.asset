  greetings:
  - "Yo dude, I got this email from this company, it\u2019s got some sick deals about
    computers on sale! I think we should take a look actually, it\u2019s like top
    end hardware for like 99% off! And it\u2019s got a 2 for one deal! What a steal!
    And it\u2019s not from RamPC! It says we gotta act quick though, the sale only
    lasts 12 hours. I\u2019m gonna buy some stuff for our department with the company
    card."
  part1s:
  - "Gully, this seems way too good to be true, don\u2019t buy anything."
  part2s:
  - "Hang on, take a look at RamPC and see if they\u2019re legit, then buy it."
  part3s:
  - Sounds good, let me know how it goes!

  greetings:
  - "Hey I have this error on my computer that I emailed you about two weeks ago
    and you ignored me. I emailed last week as well but I didn\u2019t get a reply.
    I\u2019m getting sick of this, and if you don\u2019t help me, so god help me
    I\u2019m reporting you to the manager. It\u2019s some pop up saying I\u2019m
    out of space on my cloud storage, and I can\u2019t save anything!\n\nMAKE IT
    GO AWAY!!!"
